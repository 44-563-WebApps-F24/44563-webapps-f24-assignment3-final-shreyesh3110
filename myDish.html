        <h1>Shreyesh Chennagouni</h1>
        <p>My favourite food is Biryani. Biryani is beloved for its rich, aromatic blend of spices and tender, flavorful ingredients that come together in perfect harmony. The layers of fragrant basmati rice and juicy meat or vegetables create a delightful contrast in texture and taste. Its versatility allows for a variety of regional twists, ensuring there's a biryani to suit every palate.</p>
